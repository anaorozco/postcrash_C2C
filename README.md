# Post-Crash Notification Application (PCN)

Post-Crash Notification Application (PCN) for car-to-car environments initiates a geocast forwarding with the accident info and collision coordinates for vehicles in the area. This is a simulation-based application for wireless communications in V2X environments according to the IEEE 802.11p standard and geo-routing mechanisms.

## Description

A Post Collision Notification application detects an accident based on the vehicle’s speed and deceleration of each node i.e. vehicle. Upon the identification that a collision has occurred, an accident message is sent to the nodes in the region of interest with low latency communications. 

This application is based on the communications standards defined for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE): IEEE 1609 and IEEE 802.11p. The design of the cross-layer architecture mostly depends on the intended target of the vehicular network applications; for safety applications, the goal is to notify neighboring vehicles of hazard conditions (e.g. collision ahead), thus the drivers can take actions in emergency situations.
